; Module Name:
;
;  setjmp.s
;
; Abstract:
;
;  Contains an implementation of setjmp and longjmp for EM64T.



; int setjmp(jmp_buf buf)
;
;	Setup a non-local goto.
;
; Description:
;
;	SetJump stores the current register set in the area pointed to
;	by "save".  It returns zero.  Subsequent calls to "LongJump" will
;	restore the registers and return non-zero to the same location.
;
; 	buf - RCX
;

;
; void longjmp(jmp_buf buf, int val)
;
;	Perform a non-local goto.
;
; Description:
;
;	LongJump initializes the register set to the values saved by a
;	previous 'SetJump' and jumps to the return location saved by that
;	'SetJump'.  This has the effect of unwinding the stack and returning
;	for a second time to the 'SetJump'.
