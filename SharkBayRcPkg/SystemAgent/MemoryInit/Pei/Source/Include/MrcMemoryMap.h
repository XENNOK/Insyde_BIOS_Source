/**
@brief
  After BIOS determines the total physical memory size.
  Determines TOM which is defined by the total physical memory size.
  Determines TOM minus the ME memory size. The ME memory size is calculated from MESEG_BASE and MESEG_MASK.
  Determines MMIO allocation, which is system configuration dependent.

  Determines TOLUD which is the minimum value by comparing between "4GB minus MMIO size" and "TOM minus ME size".
  Determines Graphics Stolen Base, BDSM by subtracting the graphics data stolen memory size from TOLUD.
  Graphics Data Stolen Memory size is given by GMS field in GGC register.  It must be define before this stage.
  Determines Graphics GTT Stolen Base, BGSM by subtracting the GTT graphics stolen memory size from BDSM.
  GTT Stolen Memory size is given by GGMS field in GGC register.  It must be define before this stage.
  Determines TSEG Base, TSEGMB by subtracting TSEG size from BGSM.
  TSEG should be defined.
  Remove the memory hole caused by aligning TSEG to a 8MB boundary.
  Determine whether Memory Reclaim is available.  If "TOM minus ME Stolem Memory Size" is greater than the value of TOLUD, then memory reclaim is available to enable.
  Determine REMAPBASE if reclaim is enabled.  This is the maximum value by comparing between 4GB and "TOM minus ME size".
  Determine REMAPLIMIT () if reclaim is enabled.  This is the value of REMAPBASE plus "the difference between the value in TOLUD register and the lower of either 4GB or 'TOM minus ME Stolen memory size", and then minus 1 boundary.
  Determine TOUUD. TOUUD indicates the address one byte above the maximum DRAM.  If relcaim is disabled, this value is calculated by "TOM minus ME stolen size".  Otherwise, this value is set to REMAPLIMIT plus 1MB.
